I am optimistic and cheerful. I like all kinds of sports and making friends. Good team work ability and certain professional knowledge; Rich experience in social practice; Good learning ability, adaptability and organizational ability; Have a wealth of participation and organization of congresses. When I was in school, I actively participated in various clubs, such as English club, recitation club, trumpet club and so on. I am interested in all kinds of activities and have participated in many activities, such as English volunteer activities, drama behind-the-scenes workers, and finless porpoises protection volunteers. These activities have benefited me a lot and I have learned a lot, it is of great benefit to cultivate my ability and deal with interpersonal relations, and provides a good platform for me to go to the society faster.
<br><br>

I am a person who studies hard and dares to innovate. I can skillfully use computers and master certain office software. I keep a friendly relationship with teachers and classmates, and I will actively help classmates solve problems in life. During the school years, learning professional skills is important, but ability development is also essential. I served as the monitor of my class when I first began to study. The busy work not only cultivated and exercised my working ability, but also exercised my problem-solving ability, which enabled me to calmly analyze and think carefully when faced with problems, all of which had a profound impact on my choice of major.
  The study and life in high school have cultivated my sense of responsibility and the spirit of hard work, and I have learned a lot of knowledge. At the same time, I have greatly improved my teamwork. With a positive attitude of diligence and progress, I have enriched myself in all aspects, systematically learned and mastered relatively solid professional basic knowledge, and have strong self-learning ability and the ability to solve practical problems.
<br><br>

         I have the last two years left in my college life, during which I will work harder to complete my studies and strive to graduate with excellent results. During this period, I will also participate in more interesting activities in the school, contact more resources in the school, and expand my social circle.
  Going to college means unlimited opportunities, a chance to conquer new areas. I want to enrich my life and cultivate my ability in the university. I will work hard and strive.
  That's my introduction, thank you!
